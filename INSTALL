README - Pocket City
--------------------
Pocket City is a Sim City clone for embedded devices, right now it runs on
PalmOS and GTK+ (Linux).

Pocket City is licensed under the GPL, see COPYING file for more
information.

Don't forget to read the GAMEHINTS file.

INSTALLATION
-----------
The Game is split into the program code (a .prc file) and the tiles (a .pdb
  file).
Currently there is only language support for English.

palm 3.5 - 4.99 Devices			standard-PocketCity-EN.prc
sony 4.0+ Devices			sony-PocketCity-EN.prc

The tiles are split into 5 versions, this is to reduce the memory needed
for having specific versions (and to support animation in the future).
