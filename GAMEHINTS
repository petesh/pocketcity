This is just a random collection of hints!

R = residential zones
I = industrial zones
C = commercial zones

Gameplay:
=========
* Use the hardware keys to scroll the field (IE. up/down, address book and todo)
* Tapping on the speed indicator will pause the game, tapping again will set the speed to "medium"
* Tapping on the build icon will toggle bulldozer
* Tapping on the map will jump to that position
* Tapping on the "calculator" button will bring up a quick list


City development:
=================
* R will VERY rarely settle next to I
* I/C zones only grows if there are enough R (workers)
* C will only grow if there are enough I (to produce goods)
* There must be at most 3 squares to the nearest road for a zone
* The population is calculated from the total R - I/C doesn't count

Disasters:
==========
* Watch out for the monster and the dragon - they are NOT nice to you ;)
* The fire spreads quickly. Hint: it cannot spread across clear land, so
  use that bulldozer :)
* Even if you pause the game duing a disaster, it will still spread. 


Misc:
=====
* In some versions there's a 'Test' menuoption under the 'File' menu - this
  is for testing and debugging. It should not be used.
