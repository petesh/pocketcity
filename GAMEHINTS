This is just a random collection of hints:
R = residential zones
I = industrial zones
C = commercial zones

* R will VERY rarely settle next to I
* I/C zones only grows if there are enough R (workers)
* C will only grow if there are enough I (to produce goods)
* There most be at most 3 squares to the nearest road for a zone
* The population is calculated from the total R - I/C doesn't count
* Tapping on the speed indicator will pause the game, tapping again will set the speed to "medium"
* Tapping on the build icon will toggle bulldozer
