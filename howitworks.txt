The simulation works as follows. A zone contributes a certain set of
influences onto the crime, pollution and transport maps.
Each influence level is stated as a signed byte, from -128 to +127

These influences 'exude' from the zone of most magnitude, decreasing in
magnitude as you move out from the point of influence in the following
manner:

{DIAG} | {DIRE} | {DIAG} 
-------+--------+--------
{DIRE} |  Zone  | {DIRE}
-------+--------+--------
{DIAG} | {DIRE} | {DIAG}

It is an absolute magnitude reduction - i.e. the goal is 0

DIAG values are DIRE/2 - it makes it distribute correctly on the map.

If an adjacent zone is a contributor to the influence map then for the
purposes of distribution the zone under consideration's value is
( v1 + max(vAdjacent) ) * {LOAD_FACTOR}.

These influence maps are not kept between load/saves. {BASE} iterations of
the influence algorithm are done after a load to get a rough average of the
state, but we note that we need to do an additional
Trunc((127 + {DIRE} * {BASE}) / {DIRE}) iterations before we are considered
done with the state of the system. The distribution can be performed in the
background while nothing is happening in the foreground.

How does this influence the growth?
